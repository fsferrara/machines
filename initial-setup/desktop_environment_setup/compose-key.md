# KDE - Compose Key on Wayland

Maybe you don't need to define a compose key.
If you add the keyboard layout `English (US, intl., with AltGr dead keys)` keyboard layout uses Right Alt by default as the key to access 3rd and 4th level symbols.

But since you defined Right Alt to serve as the compose key, you override its function as the 3rd level key.
