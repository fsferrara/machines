NO SOLUTION

On a US QWERTY layout in Windows, there isn't a dedicated "Compose key" like there is in some other operating systems. 
You can use United states-International keyboard layout, You can type accented characters easily without any special software.

` + a = à
' + c = ç
" + o = ö

As a programmer, dead keys are not practical since with such I have to type ` + space to get the ` character, etc. I think a compose key is better. To write something like a book, though, this is good.
