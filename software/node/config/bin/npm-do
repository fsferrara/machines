# Please, consider using the `npx` command instead of this script.

# When executables are installed via npm packages, `npm` links to them:
# - In local installs, they are linked to from a `node_modules/.bin/` directory.
# - In global installs, they are linked to from a global bin/ directory (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`).

# The command `npm bin` lets you find out where the closest executables are.

# With this script, we are including the closest executables folder in the `PATH`.
